STM32F103C8T6 PlatformIO Blinky Template
Description
The "STM32F103C8T6 PlatformIO Blinky Template" is a simple and straightforward project that provides a starting point for developing applications on the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller using the PlatformIO framework. It sets up a basic "blinky" application, demonstrating how to toggle an LED, and offers a clean template for initiating your STM32Cube firmware-based development on this specific microcontroller model.

UART communication is enabled, allowing you to easily send and receive data over the serial port. The printf statements in the code will be directed to the serial port. This template serves as an ideal foundation for STM32 development, enabling you to kickstart your projects efficiently.

Installation
To get started with this template and program your STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local environment:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sharma-kullu2/STM32F103C8_Base.gi
Open the project in PlatformIO within Visual Studio Code.

Usage
PlatformIO offers a user-friendly UI within Visual Studio Code for building, uploading, and monitoring your application. Here's how to use it:

Open your project in Visual Studio Code.

Navigate to the PlatformIO tab in the Activity Bar (usually on the left side).

Select your project from the "Projects" section.

Use the UI to build your application, upload it to the microcontroller, and monitor the application's output over the serial port.

Features
Basic STM32F103C8T6 "blinky" application template.
UART, SPI enabled
Streamlined setup for PlatformIO development.
